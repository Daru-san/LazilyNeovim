A custom Neovim configuration by yours truly
> Who's that
>> Like you don't know :(

I'm still learning a lot about lua and Neovim configuration so it's a very work-in-progress type project. It's interesting to learn about vim along the way though.

## Overview

- These configs use lazy.nvim for plugins and lua for configuration.
    - I wanted to use vimscript but it hurts my head too much so I'll stick with lua instead.
- I want to make my configuration *IDE level*,_whatever that means_, and as attractive as possible because why not
- I would love help as well, I'd love to learn more about Neovim and lua in general.
